1) Booting the IMX93-FDRM board from eMMC

* to boot the board from eMMC one can use the "emmc_boot" script
as follows:

	uuu -b emmc_boot <flash.bin> <rootfs.ext2> <Image> <dtb>

, where:
	flash.bin - boot container
	rootfs.ext2 - rootfs to use in EXT2 format
	Image - kernel image
	dtb - kernel DTB

* the "emmc_boot" script takes the following steps:

	1) Boot u-boot SPL
	2) Boot u-boot proper
	3) Write rootfs.ext2 to eMMC
	4) Write kernel Image to fastboot buffer
	5) Write DTB to fastboot buffer
	6) Append path to rootfs to kernel boot arguments
	7) Boot from the address at which the kernel image resides

* this step might not be necessary but make sure you set the boot
pins to USB.

2) Working with the rootfs

* during this year's edition you'll be working with a root filesystem,
which (most likely) you'll have to modify for various purposes
(e.g. copy kernel modules, copy your custom files, etc.).

* to do so, you can use "rootfs_util". Below are some useful commands:

	a) Mount the rootfs

	./rootfs_util mount [rootfs_path] [mount_point]

	b) Unmount the rootfs

	./rootfs_util unmount [mount_point]

	c) Unmount the rootfs and delete the mount point

	./rootfs_util unmount -d [mount_point]

	d) Copy file/directory to rootfs

	./rootfs_util copy [rootfs_path] [file_to_copy] [where_to_copy]

* when in doubt use:

	./rootfs_util -h
